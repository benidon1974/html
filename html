<font size="3" color="black">This specification promotes the integrated study of computer science. It will enable
learners to develop a broad range of skills in the areas of programming, system
development, computer architecture, data, communication and applications.

<font size="3" color="bkack">The knowledge, understanding and skills are set out in the two columns in the pages
that follow. The topic to be studied is in the first column, with the amplification in the
second column. There is no hierarchy implied by the order in which content and
amplification are presented, nor should the length of the various sections be taken to
imply any view of their relative importance.

<font size="3" color="black">The subject content for GCSE Computer Science will be assessed across three
components. Whist there is a degree of overlap between the content in Component 1
and Component 2, the context in which this content is assessed differs. In
Component 1, content is assessed in a theoretical way, whereas in Component 2 it is
assessed through its use within programs and algorithms.
